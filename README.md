# Template-Color-BST
Advanced C++ Coursework, Winter Quarter 2023: Templated Color Binary Search Tree Class

## Project Overview
This repository contains a templated color binary search tree class implemented as part of my Advanced C++ coursework at UCLA during the Winter Quarter of 2023. The project demonstrates the use of templates and class design in C++.

## Description
The `ColorBST.h` file includes the implementation of a templated color binary search tree (BST). Key features of this class include:
- A Node class to represent each node in the tree.
- Functions for inserting nodes, along with in-order and reverse in-order traversal.
- Utility functions to check tree properties like black depth and double red nodes.

## Usage
To use this color BST class in a C++ project, include the `ColorBST.h` file.
